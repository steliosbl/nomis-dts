        "description": "A concealed family is one that does not include the Household Reference Person (HRP). For example, George and Amy live at the same address as their daughter Emily and her husband and daughter. Because Emily is not a dependent child and has her own family, there are two families in this household. Family one is George and wife Amy. George is the Family Reference Person (FRP). Family two is daughter Emily, husband Simon and their daughter Eve. Emily is the FRP. As there is more than one family in the household, The FRPs are prioritised to decide who the HRP is. In this household, George is the HRP. This means that Emily's family is a “concealed family”, their HRP is George, and they will be included as part of his household in relevant outputs.",

Other households are classified by the number of people, the number of dependent children, or whether the household consists only of students or only of people aged 65 and over. This definition is used in most results from the 2011 Census. In a small number of results an alternative classification is used that defines households by the age of the household members. It takes no account of the relationships between them. In results where this different definition is used it is clearly indicated.",

        "description": "The National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SeC) provides an indication of socio-economic position based on occupation. It is an Office for National Statistics standard classification. To assign a person aged 16 to 74 to an NS-SeC category, their occupation title is combined with information about their employment status, whether they are employed or self-employed, and whether or not they supervise other employees. Full-time students are recorded in the “full-time students” category regardless of whether they are economically active or not. The rebased version of NS-SeC used in census results uses occupation coded to SOC2010. Information about the classification is available: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-3-ns-sec--rebased-on-soc2010--user-manual/index.html  In 2011 Census results, because the census did not ask a question about the number of employees at a person's workplace, the reduced method of deriving NS-SeC (which does not require this information) is used. The concept of a Household Reference Person (HRP) was introduced in the 2001 Census (in common with other government surveys in 2001/2) to replace the traditional concept of the “head of the household”. HRPs provide an individual person within a household to act as a reference point for producing further derived statistics and for characterising a whole household according to characteristics of the chosen reference person.",

A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with 1 which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

        "description": "This variable is a count of the dependent children living in a household. A dependent child is a person aged 0 to 15 in a household (whether or not in a family) or aged 16 to 18 in full-time education and living in a family with his or her parent(s) or grandparent(s). It does not include any children who have a spouse, partner or child living in the household. A household is defined as:  one person living alone, or  a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room, sitting room or dining area. This includes:  sheltered accommodation units in an establishment where 50 per cent or more have their own kitchens (irrespective of whether there are other communal facilities),  all people living in caravans on any type of site that is their usual residence. This will include anyone who has no other usual residence elsewhere in the UK. A household must contain at least one person whose place of usual residence is at the address. A group of short-term residents living together is not classified as a household, and neither is a group of people at an address where only visitors are staying.",

        "description": "This applies to a person who has ticked one or more of the UK national identity responses (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish and British) and has not also given a non-British response. A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity, people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

        "description": "This applies to a person who has recorded Cornish as their national identity. They may also have ticked another response (for example, British). A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity, people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

        "description": "The concept of a Household Reference Person (HRP) was introduced in the 2001 Census (in common with other government surveys in 2001/2) to replace the traditional concept of the “head of the household”. HRPs provide an individual person within a household to act as a reference point for producing further derived statistics and for characterising a whole household according to characteristics of the chosen reference person. For a person living alone, it follows that this person is the HRP. If a household contains only one family (with or without ungrouped individuals) then the HRP is the same as the Family Reference Person (FRP).  For families in which there is generational divide between family members that cannot be determined (Other related family), there is no FRP. Members of these families are treated the same as ungrouped individuals. If there is more than one family in a household the HRP is chosen from among the FRPs using the same criteria used to choose the FRP. This means the HRP will be selected from the FRPs on the basis of their economic activity, in the priority order: Economically active, employed, full-time, non-student Economically active, employed, full-time, student Economically active, employed, part-time, non-student Economically active, employed, part-time, student Economically active, unemployed, non-student Economically active, unemployed, student Economically inactive, retired Economically inactive, other If some or all FRPs have the same economic activity, the HRP is the eldest of the FRPs. If some or all are the same age, the HRP is the first of the FRPs from the order in which they were listed on the questionnaire. If a household is made up entirely of any combination of ungrouped individuals and other related families, the HRP is chosen from among all people in the household, using the same criteria used to chose between FRPs. Students at their non term-time address and short-term migrants cannot be the HRP.",

        "description": "A communal establishment is an establishment providing managed residential accommodation. “Managed” in this context means full-time or part-time supervision of the accommodation. Types of communal establishment include:  Sheltered accommodation units where fewer than 50 per cent of the units in the establishment have their own cooking facilities, or similar accommodation where residents have their own rooms, but the main meal is provided. If half or more possess their own facilities for cooking (regardless of use) all units in the whole establishment are treated as separate households. Small hotels, guest houses, bed & breakfasts, inns and pubs with residential accommodation with room for 10 or more guests (excluding the owner/manager and his/her family).  All accommodation provided solely for students (during term-time). This includes university-owned cluster flats, houses and apartments located within student villages, and similar accommodation owned by a private company and provided solely for students. (University-owned student houses that were difficult to identify and not clearly located with other student residences are treated as households, and houses rented to students by private landlords are also treated as households.) Accommodation available only to students may include a small number of care-taking or maintenance staff, or academic staff.  Accommodation available only to nurses. This includes cluster flats and similar accommodation, provided solely for nurses. Nurses‟ accommodation on a hospital site that does not also contain patients is treated as a separate communal establishment from the hospital (and not categorised as a hospital), so that nurses are treated as “residents” and not “resident staff” or “patients”. This ensures consistency with similar nurses‟ accommodation not on a hospital site.",

The classification of movement is based on the relative level of geography in each geography hierarchy, for example there are separate variables classifying people based on Output Area geography and on ward geography. The migrant status of children under one year of age is determined by the migrant status of their next of kin, determined in a priority order.",

        "description": "This derived variable provides a count of the number of people aged 17 or over in the household. A household is defined as:  one person living alone, or a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room or sitting room or dining area. This includes: sheltered accommodation units in an establishment where 50 per cent or more have their own kitchens (irrespective of whether there are other communal facilities), and all people living in caravans on any type of site that is their usual residence. This will include anyone who has no other usual residence elsewhere in the UK. A household must contain at least one person whose place of usual residence is at the address. A group of short-term residents living together is not classified as a household, and neither is a group of people at an address where only visitors are staying.",

        "description": "Household type classifies households in an alternative way to the household composition classification that is used in most standard census results. A household is classified by the type of family present, but households with more than one family are categorised in the priority order:  married couple family, same-sex civil partnership couple family, cohabiting couple family, lone parent family. Within a family type a family with dependent children takes priority. This means that in tables that use this classification the alternative definitions of married couple household, same-sex civil partnership couple household, cohabiting couple household and lone parent household are applicable.",

A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

This topic is only applicable to people in households. “Living arrangements” differs from marital and civil partnership status because cohabiting takes priority over other categories. For example, if a person is divorced and cohabiting, then in results for living arrangements they are classified as cohabiting. Living arrangements (Extended) offers a more detailed breakdown of people living in a couple (who are not married or in a same-sex civil partnership) than the normal “living arrangements” variable (LARPUK11).",

        "description": "Economic activity relates to whether or not a person who was aged 16 and over was working or looking for work in the week before census. Rather than a simple indicator of  whether or not someone was currently in employment, it provides a measure of whether or not a person was an active participant in the labour market. A person's economic activity is derived from their “activity last week”. This is an indicator of their status or availability for employment - whether employed, unemployed, or their status if not employed and not seeking employment. Additional information included in the economic activity classification is also derived from information about the number of hours a person works and their type of employment - whether employed or self-employed. The census concept of economic activity is compatible with the standard for economic status defined by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). It is one of a number of definitions used internationally to produce accurate and comparable statistics on employment, unemployment and economic status.",

A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

        "description": "This applies to a person who has recorded “other” as their national identity. They may also have ticked another response (for example, British). A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four  parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity, people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

        "description": "The National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SeC) provides an indication of socio-economic position based on occupation. It is an Office for National Statistics standard classification. To assign a person aged 16 and over to an NS-SeC category their occupation title is combined with information about their employment status, whether they are employed or self-employed and whether or not they supervise other employees. Full-time students are recorded in the “full-time students” category regardless of whether they are economically active or not. The rebased version of NS-SeC used in census results uses occupation coded to SOC2010. Information about the classification is available: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-3-ns-sec--rebased-on-soc2010--user-manual/index.html In 2011 Census results, because the census did not ask a question about the number of employees at a person's workplace, the reduced method of deriving NS-SeC (which does not require this information) is used.",

A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

            "description": "The concept of a Household Reference Person (HRP) was introduced in the 2001 Census (in common with other government surveys in 2001/2) to replace the traditional concept of the “head of the household”. HRPs provide an individual person within a household to act as a reference point for producing further derived statistics and for characterising a whole household according to characteristics of the chosen reference person. For a person living alone, it follows that this person is the HRP. If a household contains only one family (with or without ungrouped individuals) then the HRP is the same as the Family Reference Person (FRP).  For families in which there is generational divide between family members that cannot be determined (Other related family), there is no FRP. Members of these families are treated the same as ungrouped individuals. If there is more than one family in a household the HRP is chosen from among the FRPs using the same criteria used to choose the FRP. This means the HRP will be selected from the FRPs on the basis of their economic activity, in the priority order: Economically active, employed, full-time, non-student Economically active, employed, full-time, student Economically active, employed, part-time, non-student Economically active, employed, part-time, student Economically active, unemployed, non-student Economically active, unemployed, student Economically inactive, retired Economically inactive, other If some or all FRPs have the same economic activity, the HRP is the eldest of the FRPs. If some or all are the same age, the HRP is the first of the FRPs from the order in which they were listed on the questionnaire. If a household is made up entirely of any combination of ungrouped individuals and other related families, the HRP is chosen from among all people in the household, using the same criteria used to chose between FRPs. Students at their non term-time address and short-term migrants cannot be the HRP.",

              "description": "The concept of a Household Reference Person (HRP) was introduced in the 2001 Census (in common with other government surveys in 2001/2) to replace the traditional concept of the “head of the household”. HRPs provide an individual person within a household to act as a reference point for producing further derived statistics and for characterising a whole household according to characteristics of the chosen reference person. For a person living alone, it follows that this person is the HRP. If a household contains only one family (with or without ungrouped individuals) then the HRP is the same as the Family Reference Person (FRP).  For families in which there is generational divide between family members that cannot be determined (Other related family), there is no FRP. Members of these families are treated the same as ungrouped individuals. If there is more than one family in a household the HRP is chosen from among the FRPs using the same criteria used to choose the FRP. This means the HRP will be selected from the FRPs on the basis of their economic activity, in the priority order: Economically active, employed, full-time, non-student Economically active, employed, full-time, student Economically active, employed, part-time, non-student Economically active, employed, part-time, student Economically active, unemployed, non-student Economically active, unemployed, student Economically inactive, retired Economically inactive, other If some or all FRPs have the same economic activity, the HRP is the eldest of the FRPs. If some or all are the same age, the HRP is the first of the FRPs from the order in which they were listed on the questionnaire. If a household is made up entirely of any combination of ungrouped individuals and other related families, the HRP is chosen from among all people in the household, using the same criteria used to chose between FRPs. Students at their non term-time address and short-term migrants cannot be the HRP.",

A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

              "description": "This applies to a person who has recorded Irish as their national identity. They may also have ticked another response (for example, British). A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them. This means that in results relating to national identity people may be classified with a single national identity or a combination of identities. British identity excludes responses indicating an identity related to the British Virgin Islands and British Overseas Territories.",

It does not include any children who have a spouse, partner or child living in the household. A household is defined as:  one person living alone, or  a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room, sitting room or dining area. This includes:  sheltered accommodation units in an establishment where 50 per cent or more have their own kitchens (irrespective of whether there are other communal facilities),  all people living in caravans on any type of site that is their usual residence. This will include anyone who has no other usual residence elsewhere in the UK. A household must contain at least one person whose place of usual residence is at the address. A group of short-term residents living together is not classified as a household, and neither is a group of people at an address where only visitors are staying.",

              "description": "This variable is a count of the dependent children living in a household. A dependent child is a person aged 0 to 15 in a household (whether or not in a family) or aged 16 to 18 in full-time education and living in a family with his or her parent(s) or grandparent(s). It does not include any children who have a spouse, partner or child living in the household. A household is defined as:  one person living alone, or  a group of people (not necessarily related) living at the same address who share cooking facilities and share a living room, sitting room or dining area. This includes:  sheltered accommodation units in an establishment where 50 per cent or more have their own kitchens (irrespective of whether there are other communal facilities),  all people living in caravans on any type of site that is their usual residence. This will include anyone who has no other usual residence elsewhere in the UK. A household must contain at least one person whose place of usual residence is at the address. A group of short-term residents living together is not classified as a household, and neither is a group of people at an address where only visitors are staying.",

Family two is daughter Emily, husband Simon and their daughter Eve. Emily is the FRP. As there is more than one family in the household, The FRPs are prioritised to decide who the HRP is. In this household, George is the HRP. This means that Emily's family is a “concealed family”, their HRP is George, and they will be included as part of his household in relevant outputs.",

For example, George and Amy live at the same address as their daughter Emily and her husband and daughter. Because Emily is not a dependent child and has her own family, there are two families in this household. Family one is George and wife Amy. George is the Family Reference Person (FRP). Family two is daughter Emily, husband Simon and their daughter Eve. Emily is the FRP. As there is more than one family in the household, The FRPs are prioritised to decide who the HRP is. In this household, George is the HRP. This means that Emily's family is a “concealed family”, their HRP is George, and they will be included as part of his household in relevant outputs.",

The classification of movement is based on the relative level of geography in each geography hierarchy, for example there are separate variables classifying people based on Output Area geography and on ward geography.",

The qualifications classification counts all of the academic or vocational/professional qualifications that a person has obtained, for example A levels, diploma, apprenticeship, nursing or accountancy qualifications. People were asked to tick all of the categories applicable to their qualifications. People were also asked if they held foreign qualifications and to indicate the closest equivalent qualifications from the other categories listed. People who did this are counted in both the “foreign qualifications” category and any other applicable category equivalent to their foreign qualifications.",

            "description": "The National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SeC) provides an indication of socio-economic position based on occupation. It is an Office for National Statistics standard classification. To assign a person aged 16 to 74 to an NS-SeC category, their occupation title is combined with information about their employment status, whether they are employed or self-employed, and whether or not they supervise other employees. Full-time students are recorded in the “full-time students” category regardless of whether they are economically active or not. The rebased version of NS-SeC used in census results uses occupation coded to SOC2010. Information about the classification is available: http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/classifications/current-standard-classifications/soc2010/soc2010-volume-3-ns-sec--rebased-on-soc2010--user-manual/index.html  In 2011 Census results, because the census did not ask a question about the number of employees at a person's workplace, the reduced method of deriving NS-SeC (which does not require this information) is used. The concept of a Household Reference Person (HRP) was introduced in the 2001 Census (in common with other government surveys in 2001/2) to replace the traditional concept of the “head of the household”. HRPs provide an individual person within a household to act as a reference point for producing further derived statistics and for characterising a whole household according to characteristics of the chosen reference person.",

            "description": "This applies to a person who has recorded Scottish as their national identity. They may also have ticked another response (for example, British). A person‟s national identity is a self-determined assessment of their own identity with respect to the country or countries with which they feel an affiliation. This assessment of identity is not dependent on legal nationality or ethnic group. The national identity question included six tick box responses - one for each of the four parts of the UK (English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish), one for British, and one for “other”. Where a person ticked “other” they were asked to write in the name of the country. People were asked to tick all options that they felt applied to them.
